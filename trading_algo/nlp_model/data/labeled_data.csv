3,"Crypto miners is not a significant enough market yet for it AMD to be *that* positively affected yet in my opinion. Its getting there sooner than later, but its still not there. And aside from the crypto miners AMD is still relatively the same as it was in previous years in terms of market share and consumer interest. 

Its not a bad stock to pick up but I don't think you'll see ""big"" gains here any time soon. Gradual gains, yes. ",Bull
4,"Sold a covered call at 560. I almost wish it drops back down a bit.

To think I didn't buy an extra 540 call because the price didn't drop another 5c. Oh well!",Bear
5,NFLX because earning reports releases. +10-12% for the week is my guess.,Bull
6,Agreed 100%. When are their earnings? I'd like to jump on puts as well.,Bear
7,"Yeah, they are really awesome about it. I use TOS to do all my charting and option research, but use optionshouse to place the actual trades (lower commission than TD). Great cause I have $0 in my TD ameritrade account, since I just use it to get information.",Neutral
8,"as much as i want to just take the risk here, i'm pretty sure i'm gonna punk out and not buy in lol",Neutral
9,"? NG is like $5 spot now, thanks to the ridiculous winter. ",Bull
10,"As expected, will probably reach back to 0 by the end of the day",Bear
11,For anyone interested or who is following since closing at $5.90 (up from opening at around $5.40) it is up another .25c before opening bell today and is now at $6.15.,Bull
12,Debit or Credit?,Neutral
13,Wow good call,Bull
14,"I don't know what premium or slippage mean, but I mentioned 3x leverage for a 10 year goal, and I came to the 10 year conclusion after calculating for a net 2% yearly return after loan fees and inflation. Don't see why that isn't practical.

It will probably take longer than 10 since something will probably be margin called, yeah, but it doesn't need to be a perfect plan - just my best plan.",Neutral
15,Agreed.,Neutral
16,I thought I had read somewhere that shale breaks even around $50-60. Do you have a link for this $80 target?,Neutral
17,That's an interesting theory. What do you think would be the catalyst this ER? Apple has been selling a billion trillion iPhones per quarter already. ,Neutral

24,"Lol..

FB has transitioned into a mobile behemoth in a years time.  Would you call that monetization?  How about increasing advertising revenue 76% to 2.3 billion y/y?   ",Bull
25,"Found this in your history, I suppose this is what constitutes your investment thesis?

&gt;Stock is poised to move in a big swing. Stock is extrememly undervalued. To what price? I havent the slightest clue. business model is tried and true. (Step 1. Make successfull product x, STep 2, make more variations and develop brand.. 2A.Sponsor.. 3. Sell service and continue developing product X and its variations.. 4.Grow marketshare 5. Be the standard for competing products (Is Htc1Cam the next GoPro Product X Ver.3 killer?!). 6. Massive pullback on superior stock price ($400down to$300, $700 down to $400..$1200 down to $1000.. etc)

&gt;Company is doing the exact step by step approach that made netfilx, apple, monster (energy), etc companies super successfull and not to mention Triple Digit stocks.

All you are doing though is describing some arbitrary way of a company to expand its business, and then you compare it to Apple. You need to think about the market opportunity, expected margins, how they have a competetive advantage, their moat and stuff like that.

Tesla which is a stock everyone loves to hate, has a market cap of $30B, the market opportunity of car sales is $2T a year so clearly they have a chance of growing into their market cap and way beyond if you believe in what they are doing. The market opportuinty simple isn't there for GoPro.

&gt;The Japanese imaging manufacturers association, CIPA, has just released its global production and shipments report for the first half of the year, and there's not a lot of good news in it. Between January and June 2013 Japanese manufacturers shipped just short of 30 million digital cameras - that's a 43% drop in a single year.

The action camera market might have grown over the last years, but with GoPro selling 4-5M this year with 50% market share, that market already seems very close to maturity, I mean the action camera is a niche product.",Neutral
26,Yeah that will happen. They need to bring hairhelmet back to CNBC. She at least had abit of a clue.,Neutral

34,Personally I feel out of boredom. A 1.00 stock that doesnt pump out news is boring and people sell off because its stagnant. Its not down on any news or material info just lack of anything. Besides insider accumulation and option exercising there hasnt been a peep. ,Neutral

38,Getting in the mindset that you can call the tops and bottoms is a surefire way to get in over your head. Nobody has that kind of precision on a consistent basis. That great call was mostly luck IMO. ,Neutral
39,But what about oracles?,Neutral
40,That's why I want to go at least one strike above it... If those start getting executed it can easily pop higher.,Neutral
41,"TSLA is trading on news. Everytime some bad news comes out against TSLA, and the stock starts to fall, the executives come out with some positive news to counter it. Recently, they announced the the 2017 (cmon, that's 3 years away) Model 3, and the increased forecasts for next year. 

Watch out, and don't mistake this for good performance. ",Bear
42,"Didn't know it was that high at the time of writing, found out it was higher than 100% at my broker which was a little steep so picked up a few weekly puts last Tuesday instead, turned out to be great timing. Wasn't a big bet though as the premium on puts is incredibly high like the borrow fee, unfortunately, doesn't surprise me the bearish demand is strong on GoPro though. 

Picked up some more puts yesterday, I think we will drop further in the short term, the secondary acts as a strong resistance at $75 which I don't think will be broken, the demand is not nearly strong enough to bear a 50% larger float, I think a significant part of the demand so far has been momentum riders, which will be ready to strike along with the bears as the tide turns. The stock is incredibly overvalued here so I think support will be hard to find, might go as low as $50 within a month. I even think we will see $40 (perhaps lower) some time in the next year as the float expands fully and the hype of christmans sales fade out.",Bull
43,"Broke through $3 today. I sold off 4k shares to capture some more profits.  I'm hoping  it'll dip back below $3 before end of day so I can reload before next week where I think we'll see even more upward movement. 

I'm still very confident that anything at this level is still a double in 3 months.",Bull
