0,"I am going to stop moderating and have turned my bots off, mechafuckboy, visualmod, and wsbvotebot. It's been fun and I did my best. We've run into another situation where the active mod team no longer trusts judgment and intentions of the person (people) at the top of the subreddit mod team. Judas 2.0.

No point in spending tons of time trying to do a good job if you're beholden to someone who doesn't give a shit. I may get removed for posting this but I wanted you to know why spam is going to start piling up.

I submit, for your consideration, the [extremely hard work of the top mod](https://i.gyazo.com/bd31d2f65b33c748790e3b65d1c56df0.png) who has driven a wedge into the mod team. A man who was good friends with the deposed founder of WSB. That's everything he's done since assuming control of the sub. All of it.

656,I reluctantly bought today. They're going or be big with the hack clean up.,Neutral
657,Want to jump on but I’m afraid when I do that will be the top,Neutral
658,If you’re not buying RM⚡️G pre merger then what are you even in the stocks for? Huge battery company with tons of customers waiting and 0 debt. Get in or get lost. This should rocket past QS! Bulls on parade,Bull
659,Look what happened to CANOO and Desktop metals after merger... be careful,Bear
660,Look at QS tho,Neutral
661,Believe what? Canoo to $40? Go look at their vehicles. Wait till Joseph R. Says all electric. RMG is the future for sure. They should collaborate with QS as well to take over the battery sector.,Bull
662,This has a lot more room to grow.,Bull
663,Also - Canoo is going to be a $40 stock by February,Bull
664,"I don’t doubt either company, but I’m careful with spacs now. After watching my 1400% gain on DM evaporate I cashed out of canoo and RM at around 800% just saying it’s super risky to hold through the merger... many platforms are locked out and can’t buy/sell the day of the ticker change so the big boys unload the shares. I will buy back into canoo in a few days",Neutral
665,How did you manage 800%??????,Neutral
666,I’ve been playing the spacs as early as possible. It’s risky but I research the merger vote and try to buy leaps that expire right after the vote. Since I knew all 3 were supposed to vote in q4 I played December 18 calls for them. With canoo I bought 17.50 calls back when the stock was around $12. I scooped them at .35 each and sold them at the top somehow for like 6.00,Neutral
667,Nice brother. I still like the chances of RMG making a big leap. Any insight why QS is mooning? And why RMG couldn’t follow?,Bull
668,Honestly the QS run is ridiculous but sometimes you just gotta ride the wave. It’s retartedly overvalued but that’s just the market right now. As for RM-g I’ll be buying some puts as a lotto expecting a drop at the merger date and then I will hopefully roll those into leaps afterwards,Bull
669,Nice I like it. I think RMG will moon. Best of luck.,Bull
670,"Absolutely correct, even brokerages like Schwab have issues on ticker day change.

This reason alone I am very hesitant on holding SPACs through merger day.",Bear
671,Why do you believe that?!,Neutral
672,look what happened to XL fleet too after merger,Neutral
673,"Tell me more. What’s the time frame for the leap? Hard to believe anything can do what QS has done. Would do anything to be on that 🚀 when it launched. 

What’s the catalyst here? I’m a newb. So trying to absorb all the knowledge and wisdom I can find...",Neutral
674,Catalyst is Dec. 28 merger date (RMO) Romeo Power has solid products and long list of customers. Looking at a lot of revenue in the near future with some big time auto companies. Also- electricity is the new era we will live in. Might as well invest. It’s like oil in the 30’s imo.,Bull
675,GME only thing keeping me up in my small portfolio. Bought some dips today in NIO and PLTR. Guess we’ll see how this goes.,Bull

However, I am betting on a run up towards the event.

Usually shit cools down once this happens, but not always (RDFN lmao). Wouldn't be surprised at all if they pull the rug on those stocks and switcheroo the money to another area.",Bear
