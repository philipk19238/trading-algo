{"body": "Monetary policy, I\u2019m up 1700% for the year and my entire thesis is based on monetary policy. The entire politics industry is basically geared into a wealth reallocation to the rich. Low interest rates allow those with capital to leverage themselves to buy up assets, bidding up asset prices and giving asset holders more net worth to leverage against. It\u2019s a system of the government preventing all losses and ensuring price increases.\n\nIt\u2019s a super corrupt system, has destroyed the middle class and will eventually lead to a breakdown of the currency system or at least another, potentially worse, Great Depression, but it gives everyone with the means to go all in on assets and make a ton of money. Both parties are all in on low interest rates and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any viable political movement addressing monetary policy. Just look at the shift of popular opinion against bailouts (New York in 1975 and Chrysler in 1979) to the public demand for bailouts with Covid now. \n\nThis has allowed me to keep my cynical attitude that would usually be bearish and trade as a bull to make money. I\u2019m going to ride this asset bubble to huge money until I see some sign of monetary collapse or any move by the fed to try and start deleveraging and rising interest rates. Powell gave us the all clear through 2023, so allowing for some volatility, we\u2019ve got a bull market until 2024 at least."}

{"body": "Part of my thesis is a rejection of the idea that inflation is based on consumer psychology and is directly tied to money supply. \n\nIt\u2019s also contingent on the fact that the increase in money supply funnels into assets rather than consumer goods. Because the new money supply is distributed through the banking systems, it\u2019s is taken up by those with the means to borrow (the rich) who already consume enough to meet their demand. So their borrowing capacity goes into asset acquisition. As long as the fed ignores asset prices and concentrates on cost of goods the cycle will continue."}

Be aware though, that most brokerages charge an administration fee for registering your stocks under the new company, those can be pricey.\n\nEDIT: I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you're talking about APHA and TLRY. If you hold TLRY (the ticker they will trade under), then basically nothing will change for you except you should see a nice pop in your option value. If you hold APHA, you would also see a pop in value (actually a bigger one because you'll also get 0.83 shares of TLRY for every share of APHA you hold), but you would have to pay the administration fee of getting those changed over to TLRY. I don't know how much that would be for you.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: Realized you were asking about SPACs, so the above edit is irrelevant, but I'll leave it up in case anyone else has that question. If you're holding a SPAC, then when the merger is complete your shares/options will convert to the new company ticker, you'll have to pay an administrative fee, but everything else will be the same, except an increase in value of your options, hopefully."}

If you sell them, be sure to factor in the cost of your administrative fees in degerming what price you want to sell at. If you decide to exercise your option, then you will have to buy/sell UWM at your strike price. Good luck!"}

Bringing value closer to the books creates more stability. Look at how long it took Buffet to really invest in Apple. It just about took Steve Jobs passing away. If you want people like Buffet to really put a serious stake in you, you gotta grow up. Tesla is NOT worth more than Toyota. I'm sorry, it just isn't, not yet. Recognizing that will position Tesla to become a pillar, but doing so means playing by some rules, S&amp;P inclusion will be part of that. I think Elon is smart enough to see that he is at the Rubicon, and crossing it means preparing to become emperor as you march. His tweet about stock value being hammered like a souffl\u00e9 just makes me believe it more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla will get to $750, but you'll have a chance to buy it at a nice discount before it does."}

I know what you mean though, I wish I would've sold when they were still profitable rather than waiting for them to go red. Thankfully it wasn't too big a loss. Don't forget to use those PLTR loses on your taxes, at least you'll get something back."}
{"body": "Pretty sure I have maxed this years deduction out. I\u2019m sitting in the realm of 4k lost this year total. Was throwing pennies away in March, lost my trump bucks being a \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b in April, then May-Sept I was throwing a couple hundred in and losing that every couple weeks. Then threw this 2k in from the rainy-day fund cause why leave it in a savings account getting pennies, and was SUPPOSED to play it boomer-safe and buy shares. FOMO on PLTR and I lost 75% of it.

I've taken my savings back out and am playing with house money now (mostly losing it on CVS). \n\nLook into MVI$ (that's actually an 'S' but stupid bot banning tickers under $1bn), good cheap play for either stocks or options, quite possibly being acquired by Ford, good leadership in the boardroom, part of the LiDAR and EV boom, I got in it with what was left of my PLTR calls and just about earned that loss back."}

{"body": "That\u2019s what scares me away for now. Lockup is ending soon right? Like Jan-ish for the next wave?"}
{"body": "Yeah, it can occur within a 90 day window between Jan and March. That's why it's been dropping so steadily, more risk-averse hands are folding. The odds of an event happening that moons the stock before lockout ends gets less likely every day, so of course a lot of the speculative money is dropping out. Even if lockout ends in January, I'll probably sit tight til March, just to see how things shake out."}

{"body": "Yeah, I regret not picking up Roku, I thought it had run its course, but I got in on T before they announced that all the Warner movies are going direct to HBO, it's been one of my best plays this year.   \nWhen I look at the HBO vs Disney equation, I think HBO ultimately ends up winning, in terms of content. Disney+ has two things I want, ESPN, and Star Wars, I can get those things from other sources. But HBO? If I want what they have, I gotta go to them or the pirates. So with HBO locking up all the Warner movies and Roku getting the HBO deal, I think it will ultimately fare better than Disney+ (but let's be real, Disney as a stock is still strong, over 60% of their revenue is from the parks, once those open back to full capacity, Disney will make money.)"}

Afternoon leading up to JPOW was getting pretty dicey, but when fiscal plan was confirmed to be unchanged, we had some turbulence (maybe stop loss hunting or short covering?) but we ended back where we were at noon.\n\nWe're still not out of the woods yet, as the overshoot and dip at close looked weak. We can easily get back to 3675 levels overnight. Bad stim bill news can still derail us before OPEX, and Tesla inclusion on Monday is still something to watch out for.

{"body": "November through now was crazy. I started playing options at the beginning of November. CRWD was a month away from earnings and I was anticipating a run up. I put in 5k on a 12/18 $135 option and was scared AF. My whole RH was around 80k, I would be up or down $500 and be losing my shit. I was actually mostly right on that CRWD shit, but NIO was real sexy. Every time I thought it was the top, the top blew off. I said, \u201cFuck it, I will meme\u201d. Got burned, -5k, shit fuck this ugh no more. But then PLTR, the guy I thought would succeed even before WSB but was too scared cuz Motley Fool hasn\u2019t recommended it like they do with every stock that goes up 50% .I did what I thought was FOMO in my ROTH at $18 and, ya know what, that\u2019s actually worked at this point. But then one morning I was like, I could put 10k option on this and it 50%ed. I said, wow I made so much. The next day I saw it was up after hours and in the morning I bought 20k and it fucking doubled. Yeehaw. Weesnaw. Great day. Up 40k on options throughout the month, I thought I was bulletproof. Stonks only go up. But this was where my greed started. Over the next couple weeks I hovered around the same +/-20k range and wasn\u2019t able to concentrate on anything except getting the gains again. Then last Friday I decided to yolo on TSLA. Got scared Monday and said DIS is gonna continue going crazy. Got scared cuz DIS is classically flat. Went to ARK. Got fucked by IV somehow even though they were March calls. Terrible terrible timing. Now officially red on options. \n\nYou guys, we all gotta learn our lessons, and this is a hard one, but at least I didn\u2019t get completely wiped out and it was just losing what I had already gained. It just felt good to finally be winning. \n\nDon\u2019t let the money define you. Whether I\u2019m up 50k or down $5, I\u2019ve become addicted and I\u2019m gonna call it a learning experience. Life is short and you can\u2019t spend it stressing 24/7 over money. It\u2019s caused me to neglect my personal health, my friends and my family and that\u2019s not okay. Find the people that care about you and that you care about and spend time with them. Money can indeed buy you happiness in some ways, and if you\u2019re rich then you at least have a better path to living a cushy life, but real life experiences and relationships are priceless.\n\nI send my love to you all and hope to make money in the future with you in a more responsible way. \n\nProbably see you in January heh."}

As you can see, he would have been rich if he just kept his position at Moderna and not join the Gov in operation warp speed.   To add insult to the injury,   Elizabeth Warren  early in beginning calls him out publicly and called them corrupt but he had already donated money and sold all his shares then.

{"body": "At least people have ubiquitous sympathy and lavish fundraisers for HIV/AIDS. \n\nHerpes is stigmatized for sexual idiocy. It\u2019s the red X that prohibits anyone in their 20s from locking down a relationship. It eviscerates the victim from any hedonistic pleasure and forever handicaps them in a romantic sense. Depression runs rampant in these folk and their lives are forever changed, eternally. Even if they end up finding another lover that coincidentally has herpes, they are picking through the Island of Misfit Toys\n\nAIDS T-cell reduction can be rendered obsolete if you have the money to pay for it. Yet Valtrex is incredibly expensive for the average mid-20 year old and even if they get rich enough to afford it, then they\u2019re still just a rich guy/gal with herpes.

{"body": "Either today or over the weekend. most hospitals (including mine) are preparing to receive and start administering doses early next week\n\nthe FDA vaccine committee just recommended distribution of the vaccine under an EUA yesterday. Now all what we're waiting on is for the FDA to finalize the exact details of how the vaccine will be distributed, which shouldnt take too long."}
{"body": "The move of the day is definitely to short SNOW prior to Monday. Lockup expiration is Monday and is big relative to shares outstanding, then  there is another big lockup 15 days later."}
{"body": "would you be able to ELIRetarded Lockup expiration and why that would cause SNOW to tank?\n\nSNOW is seriously overpriced though, what exp dates are you thinking?"}
{"body": "Sure. When a tech stock IPOs it often sky rockets. Look at ABNB yesterday, and DASH the day before. Both more than doubled. But the thing is only a small number of people are actually able to sell their shares. All the early startup employees who were paid in options, all the executive options and especially the founder\u2019s huge chunk of options, all the early seed investors and venture capitalists from early rounds...none of them are allowed to sell on IPO day. They have to wait a period of time. Their shares are locked up for a period of time, say three months. So all those people have watched SNOW go up and up and up but have been unable to cash in.  If lockup\u2019s happen when the stock is likely higher than the price at which all those insiders got their shares, there is likely to be selling pressure. In the case of SNOW that price is of course way way higher. I made a ton of money playing Uber\u2019s lockup expiration and another ton playing Nikola\u2019s. I have spreads open expiring next week and next month. I also own aggressive puts expiring at the end of the month with the intention of holding until the second lockup happens.\n\nAnd I should say it\u2019s not so much that it means it will tank, just that\u2019s it\u2019s very highly likely to go down instead of up. That\u2019s why I open monster huge spreads. As long as the stock is down even a little I make the max profit. Then I bought a few puts outright as lottery tickets in case it does tank."}

{"body": "Ya, zero understanding.  The innovation of uber/lyft is applying free market economics into passenger transportation.  Supply and demand of drivers are constantly changing depending on where you are and when are you.\n\nThe traditional flat rate model for taxis were extremely inefficient.  When the flat rate is above equilibrium price, you end up with surplus of drivers.  When flat rate is below the equilibrium price, you end up with shortage of drivers.  Dynamic pricing eliminates all those inefficiencies.  That's the beauty of free market capitalism."}
{"body": "Yup exactly. Also when you look at every sector, the innovation comes from private companies not state owned ones. There's a reason Soviet Russia was decades behind the rest of the world in terms of technological advancement.\n\nThat's not to say the free market is god and must be left unchecked, but that's exactly why we have things like food regulations, minimum wage standards, (which should be higher imo) and antitrust laws (\\*cough\\* facebook \\*cough\\*).\n\nIt's funny because you see people protesting capitalism saying that they want \"publicly owned companies\" and here I am staring at stock charts all day.

Do the math here \n\nLong term thesis of tsla remains intact - 1) China delivery in Nov broke record again 2) permanent funding readily available \n\nDifference between this time vs last funding in Sep, obviously is the indexer bid.

{"body": "In general yes they are \u201csafer\u201d in a way but if you were that deep ITM you might as well just buy the stock instead because they aren\u2019t volatile at all really at that point, as far as how much they can go up in a day goes (probably not much more than the stock itself goes up or down in a day), yet your still risking the chance fucking thing really tanks and you lose even more on options than stock.

So they are both dangerous to play with. However, if I have to chose between the two, I'd choose TSLA. \n\nReason: I don't know much about PLTR and don't know any upcoming catalyst for PLTR for it to continue pushing higher beside WSB community YOLO continue pushing it up. TSLA on the other hand has a catalyst of S&amp;P500 inclusion where there will be an unprecedented amount of shares that indexers HAVE to buy in. TSLA has already run up quite a lot because of this news, but I think it's still has room to run up when indexers have to buy in. The amount of shares to be bought by indexers is HUGE and I believe it will drive TSLA up to 800 if not more by end of December.\n\nI currently have June 18 2021 800 Calls (expensive at this point).

{"body": "Don't look back. If you keep rolling your gains, you're doing good.

{"body": "one trick is to sell enough to cover the left over longer term position, that way its a free roll and you can stop 'caring' as much\n\nthat I guess should be your goal, make enough profit to buy an ATM or ITM leap then move on to the next hyped stock"}

{"body": "How long are your leaps for? Ride the trend until it's no longer a trend.   \nEither pick a price target, and just sell at that price target knowing you chose it for a reason, or hold onto it. If they are leaps, why does it matter what it does in a day or two? Even if it tanked 10% tomorrow, you still have months for it to recover, which is the beauty of leaps. If you are just holding for short term anyways, your capital is more efficient for less DTE."}

{"body": "just did my first call and tgt goes up 4%. why am i in the red?"}

{"body": "what do I want IV to be?"}
{"body": "Interesting. So right now it's recovering. Why is that?"}
{"body": "IV is always high before earnings and then drops a lot after. IV will start to go up again though if the price starts to move a lot"}
{"body": "What is your strike pice and expiration date?\n\nYou want IV to be high because it means there is more of a chance it will move significantly from it's current price, putting currently out the money options in the money. This is all gambling, higher IV is basically just like higher odds.\n\nPrior to Earnings comes an increase in volume because the efficiency for the stock changes and there is now believed to be information that major investors may not know about (huge beat in earnings). After earnings, volume usually leaves the stock as investors move on to the next money making opportunity and as that volume goes down the IV does also. The price for the stock may go up in this time but due to the lower volume and information about the stock being more widely known, your options will be worth less because there isn't as much of a chance for a huge change in price from the time you sell the option."}

I forget to claim them by agreed date. I simply lost $100, correct?\n\nExpanding on that - if I were to buy five #ZXY calls for $200 and they somehow shit to $-50,000. I (obviously) never claim the money and wait for the contract to expire. Am I now $50,200 in debt or am I still only down $200 as the contract expired?\n\nThank you so much!"}
{"body": "You don't want to claim the stock you want resell the option."}
{"body": "Run away"}
{"body": "Yes unless your broker exercised the option for you because they were itm. But iirc that shouldn't happen."}
{"body": "You belong here"}
{"body": "This is why they don\u2019t let everyone trade options"}
{"body": "My mom always told me there's no such thing as a stupid question."}
{"body": "Definitely [read through this](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012), it should answer most of your questions. If you're still not sure, get a paper trading account and try out some weeklies to get a feel for it."}
{"body": "thank you for this! Reading it now and it's extremely informative!"}
{"body": "Jesus.\n\nFor the first case, your broker will (hopefully) exercise or sell that shit for you. Otherwise you\u2019re down the 100x2.\n\nFor the second case you\u2019re down the $200."}
{"body": "There's only exponential loss if you sell options. If you're buying options, you can only lose what you put into it.\n\nMost people buy options to trade them later for profit. If you plan on holding to the expiry date you should be using them as a hedge or something."}
{"body": "Holy shit that's amazing. Thank you so much!"}
{"body": "Your broker will take care of it for you for the most part. You won't lose more than you put in, and you'll get the profit at expiration if you don't have the cash/margin to exercise at expiration.\n\n&gt; Say for instance I buy two #ABC calls for $100 and they go up to $300. I forget to claim them by agreed date. I simply lost $100, correct?\n\nFirst off, start talking \"premium\" and \"strike\" and not how much you paid for the option in total. This matters in explaining the outcome.\n\nLet's say you buy $ACB calls at $10 strike. You pay, I dunno, $3 in premium for Dec expiration (costing you $300; $3 premium * 100 shares).\n\nDec rolls around.\n\nIf $ACB is at $11, your $10 call is \"in the money\", and the outcomes are as follows:\n\n- If you have $1000 ($10 strike * 100 shares) in your account, you will get 100 shares of ACB. You can then sell them for $11, provided we open at that price again. You make $100 on the sale, but since you paid $300 in total premium you're down $200.\n- If you can't hack the $1000, your broker will sell the option at/close to expiration.\n\nWhen the second part happens: At expiration, option premium is only based on the difference between strike and current price - here, that's $11 - $10 ($1). So each option is going to sell for $100, when you paid $300 for it initially.\n\n---\n\nFor your ZXY case: Not sure how it shits the bed to -$50,000, but you only lose that premium you paid, that's correct. You can also \"sell to open\" calls or puts, and in those your losses can be larger."}
{"body": "Thank you so much for taking the time to eli5 I greatly appreciate you taking the time to write this out :) so glad the -$50,000 scenario isn't happening hahah - always thought playing this game was the equivalent of burning your life savings at a casino in Las Vegas like a boomer, but I will smarten up!"}
{"body": "&gt; always thought playing this game was the equivalent of burning your life savings at a casino in Las Vegas like a boomer\n\nIt's definitely possible to do so. Look at the example: if the stock moves in the opposite direction, or the stock moves in your direction but not as much as expected, _or_ moves in your direction after expiration, you lose cash (and all of it in 2/3 of those examples).\n\nBasically the options premium takes into account the expected stock move, and by buying a call you're saying \"nah market, we'll moon more.\"\n\nSo for a at-the-money $ACB Dec $3 call premium, a +$3 move is expected by December. This is \"IV\" (implied volatility), and will fluctuate, so a string of flat days makes options less valuable and makes for better entries. Ish.\n\nEarnings reports, for instance, have high IV before and generally \"IV crush\" after. Once you read that intro article, read more about the different greeks as well (most importantly \"theta\" - how fast your option premium goes down day to day as time runs out, and \"delta\" - how much more valuable your option gets as the price of the stock moves). These matter a lot more for OTM options."}
{"body": "If you use robinhood, they\u2019ll sell the day the options expire so you don\u2019t have to worry about holding them past expiration. \n\nYour maximum loss for owning calls or puts is what you put in, nothing more. Your maximum loss for selling calls or puts could potentially be unlimited if you don\u2019t own the underlying asset.\n\nLearn the Greeks if you\u2019re going to buy options, and don\u2019t follow most of the DD here, it\u2019s ass."}
{"body": "This isn't entirely true; they'll sell sometime 12:30-4 it it's ITM and you don't have the cash to exercise. They will exercise at expiration or let expire worthless otherwise.\n\nYou can also prevent the ITM sale by constantly putting up a sell order (something like every 15 minutes or so?)."}

Then after you get that learn how to use moving averages, trading view has a bunch of indicators that will do it for you. If you wanna get more advanced later learn how to use MACD and VWAP for intraday swing trades. \n\nBut buying into support and selling at resistance levels can really help, and you\u2019re not wondering if the stock you bought calls on is magically going to go up or down. Helps put you at ease and can help you cut a losing trade faster if you see your stock fall through support.\n\nSeriously, I know this is against the subs ethos of FOMOing on a stock that went up 20% in a week and buying the top and shouting how the stock is a piece of shit bc it won\u2019t go up 20% more.

Bought a bunch of calls last week for the 20th ...they we crushed earlier this week but have mostly all fought there way back to get me just in the green . Singles day helped i believe and the fact that the antitrust seemed to be an overreaction for JD . However when originally buying the call , earnings was set on robinhood for the 20th , then it randomly said the 24th this week and now its the 16th . My concern is its premarket 16th meaning id have to make a decision before close on friday to sell , the \"run up\" would now be left to tomorrow. After seeing pinduoduo print today after earnings a part of me wants to hold thru the weekend ... sell or hold that is the question ?"}

Dig this:  \n\n\n[https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility)\n\n\" In simple terms, IV is determined by the current price of option contracts on a particular stock or future. It is represented as a percentage that indicates the annualized expected one [standard deviation](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/standard-deviation) range for the stock based on the option prices. For example, an IV of 25% on a $200 stock would represent a one standard deviation range of $50 over the next year. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo read Options Volatility and Pricing for a more in-depth look at how all of that stuff works.

It proceeded to rocket upwards, but since I was unsure of what would happen I just sold it at like 3:59.  Would it have just automatically sold itself since I didnt have enough money to exercise?"}
{"body": "Expire worthless."}
{"body": "You can sell calls on date of expiration. In the money calls are worth a lot on the day they expire usually."}
{"body": "Your brokerage will submit a request for investigation to the SEC."}
{"body": "I would assume the option expires and you lose your money.  Unless your broker has a feature to auto sell ITM expiring options... that option expired and you didn't sell it... it's gone.\n\nIf you insta sold few mins later you would get hit for 1 day trade flag unless you have $25k in your account.  More than 3 (I think) flags in 5 business days restricts you from day trading at all for like a month.  I dunno google day trade rules.  Other than that... it's fine to buy and sell 6 mins later if you got $25k or don't mind taking the day trade flag."}

{"body": "You would have had the OPTION to BUY at 325. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t have $130,000 to buy the underlying then it\u2019s worthless. If you held through expiration you would have just given up whatever you spent for literally no reason."}

For the last five weeks I've been on isolation from my family because I'm chronically exposed by patients who cannot answer basic screening questions or lie to be seen, I just canceled our family Thanksgiving and hinted we probably wouldn't do a family Christmas either, because I have no interest in killing or crippling my father. \n\nI love mountain biking, hiking, and skiing (rip ski season) , and I'm really afraid of getting covid and being unable to go up and down my stairs, nevertheless do those activities.

More revenue in the last quarter than the last 3-4 years combined.\n* Multiple drugs in stage 2/3 in the pipeline\n* Opaganib (Yeliva\u00ae) is an anti-viral with data showing extremely good results. They have also applied for emergency COVID use with this drug, and from the looks of it, is much more effective than Remdesivir. If this emergency use is granted. oh boy.\n* The valuation is still on the mid to low end of their chart history, yet they are in the best position they have ever been. And the stock is relatively unknown, so if it gets some decent PR, that alone could be a major catalyst\n* Ark Invest has a sizable stake in them, and so far, Cathy Woods seem to be on fire with her picks, so that gives some real confidence."}

{"body": "Maybe, but they're not rendering gamestop unable to compete by going digital if they're sharing profits - unlike movie studios, game console manufacturers and developers kind of need gamestop to be around. If the only thing gamestop sold was games then maybe.\n\nIf blockbuster sold TVs, DVD players, etc. they probably wouldn't have gone out of business.\n\nIt isn't a fair comparison as BB was dedicated to a very small niche of the overall market, as where gamestop simply isn't. They have plenty of ways to capitalize on the coming changes and they seem to be positioning well imo."}

Basically just day trading and sometimes scalping spy options. Once you've identified a trend for the day you can go in calls/puts and let it ride until a reversal.\nStarted paper teading it this week and took 3 trades total, one was for almost 800 gain within an hour. I started with $1k in the account and its up to 2,300 as of now.\n\nThe tough part is sometimes it fakes a reversal and you sometimes have to be confident and not sell when you're 20%+ in the negative.

{"body": "So if calls start losing value MMs can shed shares? Is that why we see violent sell offs?"}
{"body": "its part of the reason, yeah. as markets go down, calls lose their delta and MMs will sell shares to remain delta neutral."}

Rolling, i.e. buying your CC and selling a similar one but $1 strike higher, will cost you less than $1 (x 100). But if you're assigned for a strike $1 more, you'll sell it for exactly $1 (x100) more. The risk here is that the stock may tank."}
